# ToneSmith
Custom mini MIDI controller concept

Project Overview

ToneSmith is a custom, expressive mini MIDI device designed to explore music creation in a compact, versatile form.
The goal of this project is to plan and design a functional MIDI controller inspired by the Mini Midi Magic guide, with the following planned features:

Switch/key matrix for input

Rotary encoders for expressive control

TFT LCD for visual feedback

I2S DAC for audio output

MIDI over USB

Note: This repository represents the concept phase. No materials have been purchased or used yet. This repo exists to receive Hack Club review and kit approval.

Planned Features

Compact, ergonomic layout for comfortable playing

Custom input matrix to allow unique key combinations

Visual feedback through TFT display

Audio output and MIDI communication for interactive use

Expandable design for future knobs, sliders, or case modifications
